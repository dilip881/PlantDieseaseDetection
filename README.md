# PlantDieseaseDetection
Agriculture is an important sector of the Indian economy. The Indian agriculture sector employs nearly half of the country's workforce. 
Farmers' economic growth is dependent on the quality of their products, which is dependent on plant growth and yield. As a result, in the field of agriculture, disease detection in plants is critical. Plants are highly susceptible to diseases that affect plant growth, which in turn affects the farmer's ecology. 
The use of an automatic disease detection technique is advantageous in detecting a plant disease at an early stage. As a result, it is necessary to develop computational methods that will automate the process of disease detection and classification using leaf images.
